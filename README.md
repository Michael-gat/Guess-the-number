# Guess-the-number
It's a guessing game where you have to guess a number between 1 and 20.
The correct number is randomized each turn.
It gives hints such as whether the number is too high or too low and keeps score of how many times you have guessed
Each time you guess wrong, a point out of the total 20 is deducted
On guessing the correct number, it keeps track of how many points you have
